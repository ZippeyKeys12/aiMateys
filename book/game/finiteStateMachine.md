# Finite-State Machine

A finite-state machine (FSM) is a model of computation that has a finite number of states.
It can only be in one state at a time, so the machine must transition between states.

State machines are used to implement a set sequence of actions, which can be represented as a graph:

The nodes represent states and the edges are the transitions.
For a player the states would be actions and the transitions would be button presses.
For a NPC, the transitions would be the conditions for behavior changes.
