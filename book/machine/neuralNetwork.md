# Neural Network

A neural network is a group of nodes called neurons, which are typically organized into layers.
The nodes are connected by edges which have weights that control the effect of one node on another.
Nodes can apply a function to their inputs, these functions are called activations.
They're generally trained through backpropagation, which distributes the error over the nodes based on weights and activations.
