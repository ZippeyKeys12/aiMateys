# Game AI

Many videogame AIs are not truely AI in that they do not learn, instead they create an illusion of intelligence.
However, it is included in this book as a lot of this book is from research for my Doom mod ([shameless self-plug](https://github.com/zippeykeys12/rogzis)) and it could be considered a subfield of AI.

Game AIs many times use cheating like querying the player's location when searching, which can lead to unrealistic behavior.
However, it is useful in reducing the processing power that would be required for stronger AI.
